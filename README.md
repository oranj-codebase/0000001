Literature for what is being built will be updated soon along with a whitepaper and a roadmap.

_31/07/2023_ - Version 0.01 of Knowledge Graph structure.

_15/08/2023_ - CLI WL tool being built; will be published this week.

_16/08/2023_ - CLI WL tool a.k.a `cli-quiz` ready to deploy.
            Tests will be conducted with a small cohort of 6-8 community members.
            If the process is smooth, seamless and without any friciton, it shall be published as an `npx` package.

_20/08/2023_ - Version 0.02 of Knowledge Graoh structure - updated errors.
            
Decentralised Knowledge Graph:

The Knowledge Graph version 0.01, will be developed by the .bitverse team; we are grateful that we gravitated towards each other to build out the Proof of Concept. 
The .bitverse team shall help with the development by means of recursive inscriptions.
A knowledge graph consists of nodes and edges -- the nodes are entities that contain core information, in our case, a node would typically consist of the project's name, some information surrounding it; same with founders and their information. 
The edge is what defines a relaitonship between two nodes. For example, a node which contains information on a project may be linked to another node which has information about the project or a technology relevant to the project. 
The nodes here are the individual satoshis with inscribed data and the edges are related satoshis connected by provenance to display and discover relationships.
The POC architecture can be found in the `cli-kg` folder, and was built using Neo4j and cypher query. In order to create a navigation tool, it is important to map out the area first. 
The intelligence will be provided by Ordinautz, which will turn into a decentralised knowledge graph built on .bitverse: the vision is to create a navigation tool while also imparting some education on the relevant topics.
